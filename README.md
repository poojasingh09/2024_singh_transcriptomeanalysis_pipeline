This is a set of scripts used to analyse transcriptome data from ~500 mRNAseq samples across multiple species and radiations
for cichlid fishes from the East African Great lakes. The analysis leverages short-read mRNA-seq to assemble a super-annotation
of gene isoforms that can be used to conduct differential splicing analysis at the isoform level.

The manuscripts that used this pipeline are as follows:

Singh et al 2025 parallel lakes analysis (in submisison);
Duenser, Singh et al 2025 lake victoria ontogenetic analysis (in submisison);
Singh et al red-yellow carotenoid based coloration
Singh et al in prep meta-analysis of all available transcriptomes;

If you use these methods please cite Singh et al 2025 parallel lakes paper (in submisison).

This is a set of scripts used to analyse transcriptome data from hundreds of mRNAseq samples across multiple species and radiations
for cichlid fishes from the East African Great lakes. The analysis leverages short-read mRNA-seq to assemble and curate a super-annotation
of gene isoforms that can be used to conduct differential splicing analysis at the isoform level.

The manuscripts that used this pipeline are as follows:

Singh et al 2025 parallel lakes analysis (in review https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.05.13.653813v3);
Duenser, Singh et al 2025 lake victoria developmental analysis (in revision https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.01.24.577063);
Singh et al red-yellow carotenoid based coloration (accepted Molecular Ecology, link will soon be updated)
Singh et al in prep meta-analysis of all available cichlid transcriptomes;
